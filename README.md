# 🌐 Internship Task 2 - Interactive Web Project

This project is a part of **Internship Task 2** where I integrated **HTML**, **CSS (Flexbox & Grid)**, and **JavaScript** to build a fully responsive, interactive website. It includes multiple components like a **Contact Form with Validation**, a **Responsive Layout**, and a **Dynamic To-Do List**—all designed to demonstrate practical front-end development skills.
